        <p>Hi there! I'm Melissa. I have a passion for all things design and I love kids and babies. I don't have any of my own, but my nieces and nephews are my world. There's nothing better than their pudgy little hands with a crayon in them, except watching them learn the stories of where they come from - the stories that make up our family and who they are. That's why I do this. And that's why I love it.</p>
